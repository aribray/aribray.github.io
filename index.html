              <p>I don't know about you all, but I certainly didn't know a thing about computer science when I walked
                into Ada. I had barely figured out how to turn my MacBook Air on (and sometimes I don't even get that
                right). Some of my classmates are more fortunate<a href="blog/first-entry/code-journal.html">...</a>

          <p>A team of ambitious and passionate folks have assembled and they're creating a new product called
            Startrly.
            Startrly is a new and unique solution for some problem, and it's going to disrupt some industry. They've
            hired
            you to make a new front-page for their product's website. They have a good idea for what they want in
            their
            front page in terms of layout and content, so they've provided wireframes and the HTML for the front page.
            However, in terms of literal styles, colors, and visual design choices... they've left that freedom to
            you.
