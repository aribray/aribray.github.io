                    <p><a href="https://github.com/aribray/startrly">Startrly</a> is an HTML/CSS project. A team of ambitious and passionate folks have assembled and they're creating a new product called
                    Startrly.
                    Startrly is a new and unique solution for some problem, and it's going to disrupt some industry. They've
                    hired
                    you to make a new front-page for their product's website. They have a good idea for what they want in
                    their
                    front page in terms of layout and content, so they've provided wireframes and the HTML for the front page.
                    However, in terms of literal styles, colors, and visual design choices... they've left that freedom to
                    you.
